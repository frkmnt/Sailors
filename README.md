A mobile-based card game for parties. The appeal is that, unlike other similar apps, cards are fully customizable for free.

This means the game can be enjoyed in many different ways. It's up to the players to decide what rules/decks to use, without the need to purchase additional content.

The game can be played by passing the phone around for each player's turn.
